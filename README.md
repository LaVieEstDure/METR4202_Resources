# Resources for METR4202
Here lie resources for teaching METR4202 supporting background, first compiled for the Semester 2, 2021 run of the course. You don't need to learn all of these in full depth as is offered by many of the resources below but they are good references to learn stuff you're missing, or to remember stuff you've learnt previously before. 
## Python

Python is one of the more forgiving language to learn and extremely common in Robotics (and other fields!)

ROS is a "communication framework" (not an operating system like how the name implies) for Robotics. Essentially, it helps you connect together components of what makes a robot in a way that's modular and can be swapped out and reasonably managed.
